# MetroGoods Stores Sales Analysis
## Introduction
The sales dashboards developed for MetroGoods Stores provide a comprehensive overview of business performance across key dimensions such as sales, customers, product categories, and demographics. They help address essential business questions around sales trends, customer behavior, and profitability. This report summarizes the insights gained from the dashboards and how they relate to MetroGoods‚Äô business objectives.

## Business Questions Addressed
The MetroGoods Sales Analysis project was designed to answer the following key business questions:
* Which product categories generate the highest total sales and revenue? 
*  What are the peak sales months, and how do they compare to low-performing months? 
* Which customer demographic segments (age group, gender) spend the most? 
* What is the average purchase amount per transaction and per customer?
* Which specific product categories are top sellers and which are underperforming?

  ## Who are the stakeholders?

boost overall sales.

profitability.

peak sales periods.


## What insights will help solve the problem?
### Sales trends over time (monthly and seasonal performance):
Understanding how sales fluctuate month-to-month and across different seasons
will help MetroGoods identify peak demand periods and slow months

### Customer demographic insights (age and gender):
Analyzing purchase patterns by demographic groups reveals who the key
customers are and what they prefer.

###  Category-level performance to inform marketing focus and stock management:
Evaluating the performance of different product categories (e.g., Electronics,
Clothing, Beauty) allows management to see which categories are driving
revenue and which may need a different approach.

## Concepts Adopted in the Dashboard Design
To build the MetroGoods Sales Analysis dashboards, several Power BI concepts and techniques were applied to ensure the dashboards were both interactive and insightful:
Power Query for Data Preparation


### Power Query was used to clean, transform, and shape the dataset before loading it into the data model.


 *Tasks included removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing data types, and creating calculated columns to support analysis.


* This ensured the dataset was reliable and ready for advanced analysis.


### Parameters for KPI Flexibility


* Parameters were created to streamline the use of various KPIs such as Total Sales, Transactions, Quantities, Number of Customers, and Average Price.


 This allowed users to dynamically switch between KPIs and analyze performance without needing multiple static visuals.


### Bookmarks for Navigation & Filter Reset


* They were also applied to reset filters/selections back to default, improving user experience and reducing the need for manual slicer adjustments.


### Drill Through and Drilldown


* Drilldown enabled users to move from high-level summaries (e.g., sales by category) to more detailed breakdowns (e.g., by month or customer segment).


* Drill through allowed focused analysis on specific customers or product categories, enabling transaction-level exploration.

### DAX for Custom KPIs and Indicators


* DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) was used extensively to create calculated measures such as Sales Growth vs Previous Month, Average Price Direction, and Transaction Counts.


* Directional indicators (‚Üë/‚Üì) were added to quickly show whether performance metrics improved or declined, enhancing clarity for business users.
